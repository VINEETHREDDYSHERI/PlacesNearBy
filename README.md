# PlacesNearBy

We created a MEAN stack web application to get information about places around the user. Users can get detailed information about the locations searched and save them as Favorite under their profile to use it for later.

After cloning the repo, use the below commands to run the application:
## Backend:
cd backend

npm i

npm run start


## Frontend:
cd places-nearby

npm i

npm run start


Open the browser and go to https://localhost:3000
